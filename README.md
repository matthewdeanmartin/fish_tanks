# fish_tanks
a bunch of console fish tank apps created by ChatGPT and edited by me

This is a companion site to my slide show and presentation. I'll get it up on youtube someday!

## Notes: 

- Better results if you know the language you're generating
- Crap language == Crap results e.g. bash is barely a programming language
- Some of these are safari themed, I was curious if it could handle theme change
